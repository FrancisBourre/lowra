But who's <strong>LowRA</strong> ?<br>
Is it the codename of Laura Palmer ? yes, indeed ! :p<br>
<br>
But <strong>LowRA</strong> is more than that !<br>
<br><br>
<strong>LowRA</strong> means : <strong>Low</strong>-level <strong>R</strong>ework on <strong>A</strong>ctionscript 3.0<br>
<br>
That's the next-gen version of <strong>pixlib</strong>.<br>
It won't use any features of Flex framework, never ! I suppose it could be nice later to release an extension of <strong>LowRA</strong> which build some bridges beetween the both frameworks.<br>
<br><br>
So what's the goal of <strong>LowRA</strong> at this time, now that we have native event system, mx logging framework and so on ?<br>
<br><br>
I had to reinvent the wheel (sorry guyz :p) to fit my devt needs and code design vision.<br>
That's just a matter of taste, it's not based on quality or performance.<br>
Yeah, I feel frustrated with AS3/Flex2. Incredible, no ? ^^<br>
